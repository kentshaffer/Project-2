Once active, navigate the dashboard to create a new goal. When adding a goal, you can enter the goal name, a category of your choosing, and up to 10 steps or todos to achieve your goal. Once all areas are filled in, click submit, and your goal will be stored and tied to your unique user account and will then populate your dashboard.

You may create as many unique goals as you like. To track and update your progress on a goal, navigate from your dashboard to the individual goal, and mark complete the necessary todos. The progress bar will automatically update as you get closer to reaching your goal, and all your progress is saved for when you leave the site and return.
